There are makers and there are takers.  One thing that I notice in a person is what he does with his time.  Does he enjoy the fruits another person's labor or is he one the one whose fruits others enjoy?  I like creating things.  Taking an idea and bringing it to fruition is immensely satisfying.  The bible tells us that even God himself enjoyed the fruit of His speaking everything into being.  I like relating to my creator in that capacity.

Occasionally, I offer a thought here, usually about things related to the craft of programming.  I wish I could say I was a prolific blogger, but I generally enjoy pouring my creative energies into other personal projects.  That writing here is not a priority is just being honest.

Now go make something.
