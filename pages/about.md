Hi, I'm Mario and I occasionally enjoy sharing my thoughts and ideas.

My interests include:

1. Enjoying time with my wife, my family, my friends.
2. Exploring programming languages -- anything from Ruby to Lisp.
3. Exploring new technologies and their underlying ideas.
4. Creating things: software, designs, drawings, you name it.
5. Playing [strategy board games](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/user/mlanza).
6. Taking walks and enjoying the outdoors.
7. Watching movies.
8. Watching televisions competitions like MasterChef, Design Star, Food Network Star.
9. My faith.  God is above all things and I try my best to acknowledge that.
