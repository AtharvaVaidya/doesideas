I find creating things that improve how people experience work and life an absolute pleasure.  I do that by paying attention to small details.

A love for designing web apps is what lead me to Ruby/Rails.  I've been developing software since the 90's and discovering Ruby changed how I experience work by making coding fun.  I've worked hard to learn and practice each aspect of web development from jQuery and Javascript to NoSQL databases like MongoDB.  I want clients to trust that I will deliver their concepts and so I continually learn the skills I need to get the job done.

I strive to create quality from front to back.  As far as the world is concerned, the interface *is* the product.  It's the vehicle by which we deliver an experience.  And the code?  Well, that's the product that we developers experience, so that's important too.  Writing clear code and making good design decisions gives our code longevity.  Code should be built with care for future maintenance and extension.  It should be crafted and curated by someone who cares about it.  That's me.

If you think I might be a fit for a project you have in mind, please contact me.  If you like, I could share some of my current work and walk you through some of my design decisions so that your team can get a feel for how I create.
